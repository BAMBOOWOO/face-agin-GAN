Face Aging with ipcGAN + ResNet-based Discriminator & Classifier

This project implements Identity-Preserved Conditional GAN (ipcGAN) for realistic face aging, enhanced with a ResNet-based discriminator and a shared age classifier. The model aims to synthesize aged faces conditioned on target age labels while preserving the original identity**.

Highlights

- ipcGAN framework**: Conditional GAN for face aging that explicitly preserves identity features.
- ResNet-based Discriminator**: Improved adversarial learning and gradient flow.
- Auxiliary Age Classifier**: Shares layers with the discriminator, enabling multitask learning.
- Identity Preservation**: Ensures generated aged faces still resemble the original person.
